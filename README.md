## Opionated standards

- Use Mason with mason-lspconfig to manage LSP servers;
- Use which-key to handle all keyboard shortcuts because it's easy and fun to use;
- Use mini.files as your main explorer because it is fast and minimalistic;
- You can use the standard (de facto) NeoTree as the main explorer, just uncomment it and comment out mini.files;
- Use cmp.nvim with lspkind as a completion manager as it provides great source support for completion;
- Use gitsigns to work with git stashes because it gives good highlights;
- Use Trouble nvim as an alternative to quicklist because it has a nice interface;
- Use Treesitter (actually standard) to search for files, content and other pickers;
- Use your favorite theme, you can comment Vitesse, there are several configs for different themes;
- Use mini.nvim for editor utilities because mini.nvim provides a great experience and is as minimalistic as possible;

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- RTFM, each plugin has a comment with a link to the repository;
- Don't be afraid to break something. Remember: you can fork this repo as much as you like, just don't be afraid to break it;
